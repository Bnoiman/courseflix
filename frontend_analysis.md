## Potential Frameworks and Libraries
- Frontend framework: Likely React or Vue.js based on component structure
- CSS: Custom CSS or possibly a framework like Tailwind CSS
- Icons: Custom icon set or possibly Font Awesome
- Form handling: Likely custom implementation with validation
- Responsive design: Custom media queries or framework-based

## Assets Required
- Logo and brand assets
- UI icons (search, user, bookmark, etc.)
- Course provider logos
- University logos
- Illustrations (homepage hero image)
- Default course thumbnails

## Responsive Breakpoints
- Mobile: < 768px
- Tablet: 768px - 1024px
- Desktop: > 1024px
- Large desktop: > 1440px

## Accessibility Considerations
- Proper heading hierarchy
- Alt text for images
- ARIA attributes for interactive elements
- Keyboard navigation support
- Color contrast compliance

## Next Steps for Frontend Development
1. Create component hierarchy and wireframes
2. Set up design system (colors, typography, spacing)
3. Develop reusable UI components
4. Implement responsive layouts
5. Connect to backend API endpoints
