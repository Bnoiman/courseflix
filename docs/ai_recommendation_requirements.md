     - Time commitment (hours per week)
     - Preferred learning style (video, interactive, reading)
     - Subject areas of interest

3. **Ongoing Interactions**
   - Quick preference refinement (1-2 questions)

## Recommendation Algorithm Approach

### Multi-Strategy Recommendation System

1. **Content-Based Filtering**
   - Match user preferences to course attributes
   - Use embeddings to find semantic similarity
   - Consider explicit user interests from conversations
   - Weight recent interests more heavily

2. **Collaborative Filtering**
   - Find similar users based on course interactions
   - Recommend courses popular among similar users
   - Address cold start with content-based fallbacks
   - Use matrix factorization for scalability

3. **Contextual Bandits**
   - Balance exploration vs. exploitation
   - Learn from user feedback to improve recommendations
   - Adapt to changing user interests
   - Optimize for engagement and completion

4. **Knowledge-Based Recommendations**
   - Use educational domain knowledge
   - Suggest prerequisite courses when appropriate
   - Recommend logical learning paths
   - Consider career and skill development trajectories

### Implementation Phases
1. **Basic**: Content-based filtering using conversation data
2. **Intermediate**: Add collaborative filtering component
3. **Advanced**: Implement contextual bandits and knowledge-based rules
4. **Optimization**: Fine-tune based on user feedback and metrics

## Feedback Mechanism Design

### Explicit Feedback
- Thumbs up/down on recommendations
- Star ratings after course completion
- Follow-up questions on recommendation quality
- Reason selection for rejections ("too advanced", "not interested", etc.)

### Implicit Feedback
- Click-through rates on recommendations
- Watch time and completion rates
- Return visits to recommended courses
- Sharing or saving behavior

### Feedback Processing
- Real-time adjustment of recommendation weights
- Periodic retraining of recommendation models
- A/B testing of recommendation strategies
- User segment analysis for preference patterns

## "Because You Watched" Personalization

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Course Similarity Calculation**
   - Topic overlap
   - User co-enrollment patterns
   - Embedding similarity
   - Sequential enrollment patterns

2. **Section Types**
   - "Because you watched [specific course]"
   - "Because you're interested in [topic]"
   - "Popular among learners like you"
   - "Next steps in [learning path]"

3. **Display Logic**
   - Prioritize based on recency and engagement
   - Limit to 2-3 personalized rows
   - Refresh recommendations weekly
   - Avoid repetition across sections

4. **Explanation Generation**
   - Clear, concise reason for recommendation
   - Highlight specific matching attributes
   - Use natural language generation for variety
   - Include social proof when relevant

## Technical Architecture
